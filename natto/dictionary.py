'''Wrapper for MeCab dictionary information.'''

class DictionaryInfo(object):
    '''Representation of a MeCab DictionaryInfo struct.

    A list of dictionaries used by MeCab is returned by the dicts attribute of
    MeCab. Each dictionary information includes the attributes listed below.

    :ivar ptr: FFI pointer to the mecab_dictionary_info_t.
    :ivar filepath: Full path to the dictionary file.
    :ivar charset: Dictionary character set, e.g., SHIFT-JIS, UTF-8.
    :ivar size: Number of words registered in this dictionary.
    :ivar type: Dictionary type; 0 (SYS_DIC), 1 (USR_DIC), 2 (UNK_DIC)
    :ivar lsize: Left attributes size.
    :ivar rsize: Right attributes size.
    :ivar version: Dictionary version.
    :ivar next: Pointer to next dictionary information struct.

    Example usage::

        from natto import MeCab

        with MeCab() as nm:

            # first dictionary info is MeCab's system dictionary
            sysdic = nm.dicts[0]

            # print absolute path to system dictionary
            print(sysdic.filepath)
